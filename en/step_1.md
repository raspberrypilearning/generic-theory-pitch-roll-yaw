We all know the Earth rotates around an axis that runs between the North and South Poles. All objects have **three axes** around which they can rotate. These are:

- **Pitch** — imagine a plane taking off
- **Roll** — imagine a plane doing a victory roll
- **Yaw** — imagine steering a plane like a car

If you know how much rotation has happened on each axis of an object, then you know which way the object is pointing.

Watch this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ24NtnaLl8){:target="_blank"} showing where these axes are in relation to a plane. Try to imagine a plane pointing in a random direction in space. To get the plane into that position, you can rotate it by a known amount around each of the three axes.

The image below shows where the three axes are in relation to the Sense HAT.
