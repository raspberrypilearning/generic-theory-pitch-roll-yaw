We all know the Earth rotates around an axis that runs between the North and South Poles. All objects in space or otherwise have *three* axes around which they can rotate. If you know how much rotation has happened on each axis, then you know which way the object is pointing.

The three axes are:

- **Pitch** (like a plane taking off)
- **Roll** (the plane doing a victory roll)
- **Yaw** (imagine steering the plane like a car)

Watch this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ24NtnaLl8){:target="_blank"} that shows where these axes are in relation to a plane. Try to imagine the plane pointing in any random direction. To get the plane into that position, you can rotate it by a known amount around each axis to get it to the orientation that you imagined.

The image above shows where these axes are in relation to the Sense HAT.
